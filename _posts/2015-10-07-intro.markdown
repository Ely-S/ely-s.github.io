Dear Reader,

This is my blog where I'll write about what interests me: Economics, Society, Data, and Technology. Writing a blog is something I've wanted to do for a while, and my friends told me to go for it. You can subscribe to my [RSS Feed Here](/blog/atom.xml). I hope I can be insightful at best, and not very entertaining at worst. *Stay with me.*

P.S.

I know what you're going to say, how could *anyone* juxtapose Comic Sans and Baskerville on the same page?? I don't care. It makes me happy.
