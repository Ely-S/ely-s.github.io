title: About Me

*I'm an SF Bay Area-based data scientist*

I have been programming since I was 13. I love coding for fun and contributing when I think I can help a project. Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ely-S)!

I like data science because it's *even more* interesting to me than programming. It's programming + real-world problems + statistics. The ridiculously complicated challanges, and the sophisticated solutions, of statistical inference fascinate me. Occasionally I'll write about econometrics, the statistical and intellectual toolkit economists use to solid inferences about complex systems.

*This is my blog and homepage on the web.* I like to share my modest knowledge of data science and programming in the hopes of helping others in my field. Please send me an email if you have any questions or comments.
